# Homebrew cask for the menu bar app, in the tap datlechin/homebrew-tap.
#
# Pitboard's release writes the tap's copy from packaging/pitboard-app.rb in
# datlechin/pitboard the way it writes pitboard.rb, in the same commit, so the pair cannot
# be half updated. An edit made to the tap's copy is replaced at the next release. The
# download is the notarised build from the release, so Gatekeeper accepts it with no further
# step. Sparkle keeps it up to date afterwards, which is why auto_updates is set.
#
# The app carries the command line at Contents/Helpers/pitboard, with its man page and
# completions, and this links them where the pitboard cask would. They are paths into the
# bundle, so a Sparkle update moves the command line with the app.

  # The renewal schedule in zap and not uninstall, because Homebrew runs uninstall on every
  # upgrade and reinstall too. ~/.pitboard stays: it is the only index of the parked logins,
  # and without it they are left where nothing can name them. `pitboard uninstall` deletes
  # the logins and then the directory, so it has to come first.

  # application state keeps the windows that were open. The Share extension's container and
  # scripts folder are made by macOS the first time the extension runs, and hold nothing
