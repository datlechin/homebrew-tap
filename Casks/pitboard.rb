# Homebrew cask for the command line on macOS and Linux, in the tap datlechin/homebrew-tap.
#
# pitboard's release writes the tap's copy from packaging/pitboard.rb in datlechin/pitboard,
# with the version and the checksums from the release's SHA256SUMS filled in. An edit made
# to the tap's copy is replaced at the next release.
#
# The download is the release's own tarball for the machine, attested, and on macOS signed
# and notarised, so nothing is built and nobody needs Rust.

  caveats <<~EOS
    On macOS the menu bar app is the pitboard-app cask, and it includes this command line.
    To switch to it, or to get back an app the old pitboard cask installed:
      brew uninstall --cask pitboard
      brew uninstall --formula --force pitboard
      brew install --cask datlechin/tap/pitboard-app
    The second line removes 0.3.0's formula if it is still there, and does nothing if not.

    To remove pitboard with the logins it parked, run `pitboard uninstall` before
    `brew uninstall`.
